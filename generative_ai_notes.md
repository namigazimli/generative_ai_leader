Multimodal GenAI - Gen AI can process and integrate information from diverse formats like plain text, images, videos, audio, and PDFs. This capability–known as multimodal gen AI–means that models can process various input types individually or combine multiple kinds of data simultaneously.

Vertex AI is Google Cloud's unified machine learning (ML) platform. It empowers you to build, train, and deploy ML models and AI applications. For multiple modalities (text, code, images, speech), Vertex AI gives you access to Google's large generative AI models through Model Garden. You can tune Google's LLMs to meet your needs, and then deploy them for use in your AI-powered applications.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) - Computer systems perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
Machine Learning (ML) - Systems learn from data to solve specific problems.

Gemini - Trained on a massive dataset of text, images, code, audio, video, and more. This multimodal training allows Gemini to perform tasks across various domains, including language understanding, image generation, code generation, and more.
Imagen - Trained primarily on a massive dataset of images and text descriptions. This enables Imagen to generate high-quality images from text descriptions, perform image editing tasks, and understand the content of images.
Chirp - Trained on a large dataset of audio in various languages. Chirp is designed for speech recognition and can be used for tasks like voice assistants, transcription, and translation. Find information at the right time.

Foundation models, like other AI models, take in inputs, which are called prompts, to produce outputs.
While all AI models have inputs or prompts, foundation models are usually much more flexible in what you can prompt. For example, some AI models have strict requirements on the type of inputs they can handle. They may only handle numbers, emails, or images.
Foundation models, and especially multimodal foundation models, can take in a much broader set of inputs.

AI Augmentation implies using machine learning and natural language processing to help make better decisions. AI systems are built to work with humans, proposing suggestions or insights but leaving the final call to the individual.
AI Automation implies creating systems that perform tasks without needing any human intervention. Imagine bots handling repetitive tasks like processing invoices or AI-powered chatbots that deal with customer queries from start to finish. Here, AI is replacing human effort by doing the job itself.

Artificial intelligence (AI): The broad field of building machines that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence.
Machine learning (ML): A subset of AI where machines learn from data.
Generative AI: An application of AI that creates new content.


### Data quality ###
1. Accuracy - If the data is inaccurate, the model will learn incorrect patterns and make faulty predictions. Imagine teaching a child about animals using a book with mislabeled pictures—they would learn the wrong things. The same applies to AI.
2. Completeness - Completeness refers to the size of a dataset as well as representation within the dataset. The size of the dataset is important because the model needs enough to make an accurate prediction. If a meteorologist tries to predict weather only based on the data of the past day, it will be a much worse prediction than if it used a much larger sample size.
3. Representative - Data needs to be representative and inclusive, otherwise it can lead to skewed samples and biased outcomes. If a dataset about customer preferences is missing information about a certain demographic, the model might make inaccurate or biased generalizations about that group.
4. Consistency - Inconsistent data formats or labeling can confuse the model and hinder its ability to learn effectively. Imagine trying to assemble a puzzle where some pieces are labeled with numbers and others with letters—it would be a mess.
5. Relevance - The data must be relevant to the task the AI is designed to perform. For example, data about traffic patterns in London is unlikely to be helpful for predicting crop yields in Kansas.


### Data accessibility ###
1. Availability - If the necessary data simply is not available, the AI model can not be trained. For some problems, the data might exist, but it might be locked behind paywalls or restricted due to privacy concerns.
2. Cost - Gathering and cleaning data can be expensive. The cost of acquiring high-quality data can be a significant barrier to AI development, especially for smaller organizations.
3. Format - Data needs to be in a format that the AI model can understand and process. Converting data into the appropriate format can be time-consuming and technically challenging.


### Machine learning approaches and data requirements ###

The quality, accessibility, and form of data are fundamental, but how that data is used for ML depends on the specific learning method. Machine learning has three primary learning approaches: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each with its own data requirements.
Supervised models rely on labeled data, unsupervised models work with unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning learns through interaction and feedback.

Labeled data  has tags, such as a name, type, or number. These tags, whether applied manually or by automated systems, assign meaning to the data. 
For instance, an image dataset for training a cat-detection model would label each picture as either a cat or dog. Similarly, a set of customer reviews might be labeled as positive, negative, or neutral. These labels enable algorithms to learn relationships and make accurate predictions.

Unlabeled data is simply data that is not tagged or labeled in any way. It is raw, unprocessed information without inherent meaning. 
Examples of unlabeled data include a collection of unorganized photos, a stream of audio recordings, or website traffic logs without user categorization. In these cases, algorithms must independently discover patterns and structures within the data, as there are no pre-existing labels to guide the learning process.

Supervised machine learning - trains models on labeled data, where each input is paired with its correct output, allowing the model to learn the relationship between them. The models goal is to identify patterns and relationships within this labeled data, enabling it to accurately predict outputs for new, unseen inputs.
Predicting housing prices is a common example of supervised learning. A model is trained on a dataset where each house has labeled data, such as its size, number of bedrooms, location, and the corresponding sale price. This labeled data allows the algorithm to learn the relationship between the features of a house and its price. Once trained, the model can then predict the price of a new house based on its features.

Unsupervised ML models - deal with raw, unlabeled data to find natural groupings. Instead of learning from labeled data, it dives headfirst into a sea of unlabeled data. 
For example, an unsupervised learning algorithm could analyze customer purchase history from your companys database. It might uncover hidden segments of customers with similar buying habits, even though you never explicitly labeled those segments beforehand. This can be incredibly valuable for targeted marketing or product recommendations.
Think of it as exploratory analysis. Unsupervised learning helps you understand the underlying structure of your data and uncover insights that you might not have even known to look for.

### Reinforcement learning ###

Reinforcement learning is all about learning through interaction and feedback. Imagine a robot learning to navigate a maze. It starts with no knowledge of the maze's layout. As it explores and interacts with the maze, it collects data—bumping into walls (negative feedback) or finding shortcuts (positive feedback). Through this process of trial and error, the algorithm learns which actions lead to the best outcomes. It's like training a pet. You reward good behavior and discourage bad behavior. And over time, the pet learns to perform the desired actions. Similarly, in reinforcement learning, the algorithm learns to maximize rewards and minimize penalties by interacting with its environment. This type of learning is particularly useful in situations where you can't provide explicit instructions or labeled data. For example, you could use reinforcement learning to train a self-driving car to navigate complex traffic situations or to optimize the performance of a robot in a manufacturing plant.

### Examples of machine learning approaches on Google Cloud ####

1. Predictive maintenance with Vertex AI (supervised learning) - By training a model on sensor data from machines like temperature, pressure, and vibration, Vertex AI can predict when a machine is likely to fail, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime.

2. Anomaly detection with BigQuery ML (unsupervised learning) - BigQuery ML can analyze historical transaction data (amount, location, time, etc.) to identify patterns and flag unusual transactions that deviate significantly from the norm. This helps prevent fraud and minimize financial losses.

3. Product recommendations with Vertex AI (reinforcement learning) - Vertex AI can train a reinforcement learning model to recommend products to users based on their browsing history, purchase behavior, and other factors. The model learns to maximize user engagement and sales by continuously refining its recommendations.

### Data tools and management for ML workloads ###

Google Cloud offers a comprehensive suite of data tools and management capabilities tailored for ML workloads. These tools and capabilities are designed to support the entire ML lifecycle, from data preparation and model training to deployment and monitoring. 

1. Gather the data - Data gathering, also called data ingestion, involves collecting raw data from various sources. To effectively train and test your model, determine the data you need based on the outcome you want to achieve. Google Cloud supports data ingestion through several tools. 
- Pub/Sub handles real-time streaming data processing, regardless of the structure of the data.
- Cloud Storage is well-suited for storing unstructured data.
- Cloud SQL and Cloud Spanner are used to manage structured data.

2. Prepare your data - Data preparation is the process of cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format for analysis or model training. This involves formatting and labeling data properly. Google Cloud offers tools like BigQuery for data analysis and Data Catalog for data governance. These tools help prepare data for ML models. 
- With BigQuery, you can filter data, correct its inconsistencies, and handle missing values. 
- With Data Catalog, you can find relevant data for your ML projects. This tool provides a centralized repository to easily discover datasets in your organization.

3. Train your model - The process of creating your ML model using data is called model training. Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform provides a managed environment for training ML models. 
With Vertex AI, you can set parameters and build your model, using prebuilt containers for popular machine learning frameworks, custom training jobs, and tools for model evaluation. Vertex AI also provides access to powerful computing resources to make the model training process faster.

4. Deploy and predict - Model deployment is the process of making a trained model available for use. 
Vertex AI simplifies this by providing tools to put the model into action for generating predictions. This includes scaling the deployment, which means adjusting the resources allocated to the model to handle varying amounts of usage.

5. Manage your model - Model management is the process of managing and maintaining your models over time. Google Cloud offers tools for managing the entire lifecycle of ML models. This includes the following.
- Versioning: Keep track of different versions of the model.
- Performance tracking: Review the model metrics to check the model's performance.
- Drift monitoring: Watch for changes in the model's accuracy over time.
- Data management: Use Vertex AI Feature Store to manage the data features the model uses.
- Storage: Use Vertex AI Model Garden to store and organize the models in one place.
- Automate: Use Vertex AI Pipelines to automate your machine learning tasks.

All these Google Cloud tools are designed to work together seamlessly. You can also connect them with your existing tools or build your own custom solutions. And throughout the entire process, Google Cloud's infrastructure ensures your solution is available and reliable. At the same time, Identity and Access Management (IAM) keeps your data safe and ensures only the right people have access.

#### Deep learning ####

A broad field that encompasses many different techniques, one of which is deep learning (DL). Deep learning is a powerful subset of machine learning, distinguished by its use of artificial neural networks. These networks enable the processing of highly complex patterns and the generation of sophisticated predictions. Neural networks can leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, a strategy known as semi-supervised learning. They train on a blend of a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. That way, they learn foundational concepts and generalize effectively to novel examples. Generative AI uses the power of deep learning to create new content spanning text, images, audio, and beyond. Deep learning techniques, particularly those centered on neural networks, are the engine behind these generative models.

Remember foundation models from course one? Foundation models use deep learning. They are trained on massive datasets that allow them to learn complex patterns and perform a variety of tasks across different domains. They are incredibly powerful machine learning models trained on a massive scale, often using vast amounts of unlabeled data. This training allows them to develop a broad understanding of the world, capturing intricate patterns and relationships within the data they consume. Think of a foundation model as a highly advanced learner. It's like a student who has read everything in an entire library, absorbing knowledge from countless books, articles, and websites. This deep and extensive learning allows foundation models to be adapted to a wide range of tasks.

Large Language Models (LLMs) - One particularly exciting type of foundation model is the LLM. These models are specifically designed to understand and generate human language. They can translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange. This is likely the most common foundation model you've encountered, such as in popular generative AI chatbots like Gemini. They also help power many search engines you use today. 

Diffusion models - Diffusion models are another type of foundational model. They excel in generating high-quality images, audio, and even video by iteratively refining noise (or unstructured/random data and patterns) into structured data.


### Factors when choosing a model for your use case ###

1. Modality - When selecting a generative AI model, it's crucial to consider the modality of your input and output. Modality refers to the type of data the model can process and generate, such as text, images, video, or audio. If your application focuses on a single data type, like generating text-based articles or creating audio files, you'll want to choose a model optimized for that specific modality. For applications that require handling multiple data types, such as generating image captions (processing images and producing text) or creating video with accompanying audio, you'll need a multimodal model. These models can understand and synthesize information across different modalities.

2. Context window - The context window refers to the amount of information a model can consider at one time when generating a response. A larger context window allows the model to "remember" more of the conversation or document, leading to more coherent and relevant outputs, especially for longer texts or complex tasks. However, larger context windows often come with increased computational costs. You need to balance the need for context with the practical limitations of your resources.

3. Security - Security is paramount, especially when dealing with sensitive data. Consider the model's security features, including data encryption, access controls, and vulnerability management. Ensure the model complies with relevant security standards and regulations for your industry.

4. Availability and reliability - The availability and reliability of the model are crucial for production applications. Choose a model that is consistently available and performs reliably under load. Consider factors like uptime guarantees, redundancy, and disaster recovery mechanisms.

5. Cost - Generative AI models can vary significantly in cost. Consider the pricing model, which might be based on usage, compute time, or other factors. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the model in relation to your budget and the expected value of your application. This is where selecting the right model for the right task is important. Be sure to match the model to the task; bigger isn't always better, and multi-modal capabilities aren't always necessary.

6. Performance - The performance of the model, including its accuracy, speed, and efficiency, is a critical factor. Evaluate the model's performance on relevant benchmarks and datasets. Consider the trade-offs between performance and cost.

7. Fine-tuning and customization - Some models can be fine-tuned or customized for specific tasks or domains. If you have a specialized use case, consider models that offer fine-tuning capabilities. This often involves training the model further on a specific dataset related to your use case.

8. Ease of integration - The ease of integrating the model into your existing systems and workflows is an important consideration. Look for models that offer well-documented APIs and SDKs.
